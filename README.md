# Pall scripting

# Introduction

This is a chatbot designed to generate scripts for the CTC automated rails
for laboratory automation. The chatbot is designed to be used by the
analyst to use natural language to build the script. This can be a time intensive access and prone to error.

This will also open the way to using generative AI to update scripts
on the fly. This will allow the scripts to be updated in real time depending
on the outcome of a previous experiment.
